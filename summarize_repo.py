Create a clear, step-by-step technical onboarding guide from the README.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- Use *text* for bold (single asterisks, not double)
- Use `code` for commands and file names (backticks)
- Use simple bullet points with ‚Ä¢
- Keep formatting minimal and clean

Format your response as follows:

*üì± About {repo_name.title()}*
[1-2 sentence description of what the app does]

*üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions*
1. [First step with specific commands in `backticks`]
2. [Second step...]
3. [Continue with all setup steps]

*üîë Required Configuration*
‚Ä¢ [List any API keys, environment variables, or credentials needed]
‚Ä¢ [Be specific about where to get them or who to ask]

*‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project*
‚Ä¢ [Command to start the development server/build in `backticks`]
‚Ä¢ [Where to view the running app]

*üìö Key Resources*
‚Ä¢ [Link to documentation if mentioned]
‚Ä¢ [Any important files or directories to know about]

Be specific with commands (e.g., `npm install`, `pod install`, `python manage.py runserver`).
If the README mentions dependencies, list them clearly.
If setup steps are unclear in the README, note what information is missing.
